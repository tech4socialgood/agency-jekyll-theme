**The curriculum advocacy team works as a cross-major/school coalition to make sure ALL students, especially those getting a technical degree, are able to look at technologies through a critical lens and analyze how they are impacted by larger social/political contexts.**

<h4>Our Efforts include:</h4>
1. advocating for required coursework in classes that address systemic oppression
2. encouraging more multi-disciplinary courses in education/health/law and technology
3. designing technical courses that emphasize asking **whether we should build something, what the unintended consequences might be, and who exactly we are serving in each product we make.**

In the 2020-2021 school year, the curriculum advocacy team researched and compiled a T4SG course guide for the campus community, consolidating classes
across all departments that critically rethink technology in the
broader social context.

Check out the course guide [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTS3tjkTO4oTQKSJnFOUOwJo6J-_Gq5DH7b9ue4jxqBKVLtXOfg_7pXb6Gp9GnFjbB_i3if8fdcd9zS/pubhtml).
