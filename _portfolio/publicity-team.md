**The publicity team helps getting the word out about our events and mission by designing posters and other publicity materials, identifying relevant student groups / student populations to share our events with, managing our social media presence, and maintaining our website (like this!)**

In the past year, we created T4SG T-shirts and stickers for our members to purchase. We are anticipating more merch options, a revamped website, and wider
presence with external partner connections.

Stay tuned for more designs, merches, and freebies in the upcoming year and joing us to create your own version of T4SG!
